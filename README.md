# Carbon_Footprint_tracker
This is a web app that is intended to compute and display a footprint estimate from Vehicle(Cars) emissions.
The API used for this project is from https://www.carboninterface.com/ and I'm utilizing this specific endpoint(https://www.carboninterface.com/api/v1/estimates) for Vehicle Emissions estimates.
I've been using HTML, CSS and Javascript languages with Generative Tools to build and structure the code from scratch.
Gemini and ChatGPT were primarily used.
Right now, I'm a crisis of completing this project as the API endpoint seems to return an error 422 Unprocessable Content.
I have tried several ways to structure the Estimate Request but all have failed terribly.
I have considered using an alternative approach(using Emission standards calculation) to get a footprint estimate. 
But I could use any one of yours help.
